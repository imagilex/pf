<h1>44 Promises of the Medicine Buddhas</h1>

<p>In the dedication prayer at the end of the sadhana it says:</p>

<p><strong>
    Through my virtues from prostrating, making offerings, and reciting the names of the Assembly of Seven Sugatas, <br />
    May the supreme prayers that they previously made <br />
    - The two sets of eight, the four sets of four, and the twelve promises - <br />
    Immediately ripen upon me and all other living beings.
