<h1>Liberation from Sorrow</h1>

<h4>Going for refuge</h4>

<p>
    I and all sentient beings, until we achieve enlightenment, <br />
    Go for refuge to Buddha, Dharma and Sangha. (3x)
</p>

<h4>Generating bodhichitta</h4>

<p>
    Through the virtues I collect by giving and other perfections, <br />
    May I become a Buddha for the benefit of all. (3x)
</p>

<h4>Generating the four immeasurables</h4>

<p>
May all sentient beings possess happiness and its causes, <br />
May they be free from suffering and its causes, <br />
May they never be separated from the happiness that is without suffering, <br />
May they abide in equanimity, without feeling close to some out of attachment or distant from others out of hatred.
</p>

<h4>Inviting Arya Tara</h4>

<p>
From the supreme abode of Potala,  <br />
Born from the green letter TAM,  <br />
You who liberate migrators with the light of the letter TAM  <br />
O Tara, please come here together with your retinue.
</p>

<h4>Prostration</h4>

<p>
    Gods and demi-gods bow their crowns <br />
    At your lotus feet; <br />
    O Liberator from all misfortune, <br />
    To you, Mother Tara, I prostrate.
</p>

<h4>Prayer of seven limbs</h4>

<p>
    To Venerable Arya Tara <br />
    And all the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas <br />
    Residing in the ten directions and the three times, <br />
    I prostrate with sincere faith.
</p>

<p>
    I offer you flowers, incense, lights, <br />
    Perfumes, foods, music and other offerings, <br />
    Both actually set out and mentally imagined; <br />
    Please accept these, O Assembly of Aryas.
</p>

<p>
    I confess all negative actions, <br />
    The five heinous actions and the ten non-virtues, <br />
    That I have committed since beginningless time <br />
    Through my mind being overcome by delusions.
</p>

<p>
    I rejoice in the merit of all the virtues <br />
    Collected throughout the three times <br />
    By Bodhisattvas, Solitary Conquerors, <br />
    Hearers, ordinary beings and others.
</p>

<p>
    Please turn the Wheel of Dharma <br />
    Of the great, small and common vehicles, <br />
    According to the different wishes <br />
    And capacities of living beings.
</p>

<p>
    For as long as samsara has not ceased, <br />
    Please do not pass beyond sorrow; <br />
    But with compassion care for all living beings <br />
    Drowning in the ocean of suffering.
</p>

<p>
    May all the merit I have collected <br />
    Become the cause of enlightenment; <br />
    And before too long may I become <br />
    The Glorious Guide of migrators.
</p>

<h4>Requesting fulfilment of wishes</h4>

<p>
    O Venerable, Blessed, Compassionate Mother, <br />
    May I and all countless living beings <br />
    Quickly purify the two obstructions, complete the two collections, <br />
    And attain the state of complete Buddhahood.
</p>

<p>
    Throughout all our lives before we reach Buddhahood, <br />
    May we attain the supreme happiness of humans and gods; <br />
    And so that we may accomplish the omniscient mind, <br />
    Please quickly pacify and eliminate all interferences,
</p>

<p>
    Evil spirits, hindrances, epidemics and sickness, <br />
    As well as the various causes of untimely death, <br />
    Bad dreams, ill omens, the eight fears, <br />
    And all other forms of danger.
</p>

<p>
    May all mundane and supramundane collections <br />
    of good fortune, happiness, goodness and excellence increase, <br />
    And may every beneficial purpose without exception <br />
    Be effortlessly and spontaneously accomplished.
</p>

<p>
    May I strive in my practice of sacred Dharma and increase myrealizations, <br />
    May I always accomplish you and behold your sublime face; <br />
    And may my understanding of emptiness and the precious bodhichitta <br />
    Increase and grow like a waxing moon.
</p>

<p>
    May I be born from a sacred and most beautiful lotus <br />
    In the excellent, joyful mandala of the Conqueror; <br />
    And there may I accomplish the prophecy I receive <br />
    Directly from Conqueror Amitabha.
</p>

<p>
    O Goddess upon whom I have relied in previous lives, <br />
    Embodiment of the divine actions of all the Buddhas of the three times, <br />
    Bluish-green One with one face and two hands, <br />
    O Swift Pacifier, Mother holding an upala, may everything be auspicious.
</p>

<p>
    O Conqueror Mother Tara, <br />
    Whatever your body, retinue, life span and Pure Land, <br />
    And whatever your supreme and excellent name, <br />
    May I and all others attain only these.
</p>

<p>
    Through the force of my making these praises and requests to you, <br />
    Please pacify all sickness, poverty, misfortune, fighting and quarrelling, <br />
    Throughout all directions where I and others live, <br />
    And cause the Dharma and all good fortune to flourish.
</p>

<h4>Mantra recitation</h4>

<p>OM TARE TUTTARE TURE SÖHA (21x, 100x, etc.)</p>

<p><em>
    The meaning of this mantra is: with OM we are calling Arya Tara,
    TARE means permanent liberation from the suffering of lower
    rebirth, TUTTARE means permanent liberation from samsaric
    rebirth, TURE means the great liberation of full enlightenment, and
    SÖHA means please bestow. Together the meaning is: 'O Arya
    Tara, please bestow upon us permanent liberation from the
    suffering of lower rebirth, permanent liberation from the suffering
    of samsaric rebirth, and the great liberation of full enlightenment.'
</em></p>

<h4>Dedication</h4>

<p>
    By this virtue may I quickly <br />
    Become Arya Tara, <br />
    And then lead every living being <br />
    Without exception to that ground.
</p>

<p>
    Through the virtues I have collected <br />
    By worshipping the Blessed Mother, <br />
    May every living being without exception <br />
    Be born in the Pure Land of Bliss.
</p>

<h4>Auspicious verse</h4>

<p>
    You, who having abandoned all bodily faults, possess the signs and indications, <br />
    Who having abandoned all verbal faults, possess a heavenly voice, <br />
    Who having abandoned all mental faults, realize all objects of knowledge; <br />
    O Lady of blessed, glorious renown, may there be the auspiciousness of your presence.
</p>

<h4>Prayers for the Virtuous Tradition</h4>

<p>
    So that the tradition of Je Tsongkhapa, <br />
    The King of the Dharma, may flourish, <br />
    May all obstacles be pacified <br />
    And may all favourable conditions abound.
</p>

<p>
    Through the two collections of myself and others <br />
    Gathered throughout the three times, <br />
    May the doctrine of Conqueror Losang Dragpa <br />
    Flourish for evermore.
</p>

<h4>The nine-line Migtsema prayer</h4>

<p>
    Tsongkhapa, crown ornament of the scholars of the Land of the Snows, <br />
    You are Buddha Shakyamuni and Vajradhara, the source of all attainments, <br />
    Avalokiteshvara, the treasury of unobservable compassion, <br />
    Manjushri, the supreme stainless wisdom, <br />
    And Vajrapani, the destroyer of the hosts of maras. <br />
    O Venerable Guru-Buddha, synthesis of all Three Jewels, <br />
    With my body, speech and mind, respectfully I make requests: <br />
    Please grant your blessings to ripen and liberate myself and others, <br />
    And bestow the common and supreme attainments. (3x)
