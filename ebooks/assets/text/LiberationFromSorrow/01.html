<h1>Liberation from Sorrow <small>PRAISES AND REQUESTS TO THE TWENTY-ONE TARAS</small></h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
    Tara is a female Buddha, a manifestation of the ultimate wisdom of all
    the Buddhas. Each of the Twenty-one Taras is a manifestation of the
    principal Tara, Green Tara. Tara is also known as the 'Mother of the
    Conquerors'.
</p>

<p>
    Tara is our common mother, our Holy Mother. When we are young we
    turn to our worldly mother for help. She protects us from immediate
    dangers, provides us with all our temporal needs, and guides and
    encourages us in our learning and personal development. In the same
    way, during our spiritual growth we need to turn to our Holy Mother,
    Tara, for refuge. She protects us from all internal and external dangers,
    she provides us with all the necessary conditions for our spiritual
    training, and she guides us and inspires us with her blessings as we
    progress along the spiritual path.
</p>

<p>
    'Tara' means 'Rescuer'. She is so called because she rescues us from
    the eight outer fears (the fears of lions, elephants, fire, snakes, thieves,
    water, bondage and evil spirits), and from the eight inner fears (the fears
    of pride, ignorance, anger, jealousy, wrong views, attachment,
    miserliness and deluded doubts). Temporarily Tara saves us from the
    dangers of rebirth in the three lower realms, and ultimately she saves us
    from the dangers of samsara and solitary peace.
</p>

<p>
    If we rely upon Mother Tara sincerely and with strong faith, she will
    protect us from all obstacles and fulfil all our wishes. Since she is a
    wisdom Buddha, and since she is a manifestation of the completely
    purified wind element, Tara is able to help us very quickly. If we recite
    the twenty-one verses of praise, we shall receive inconceivable benefits.
    These praises are very powerful because they are Sutra, the actual
    words of Buddha. It is good to recite them as often as we can.
